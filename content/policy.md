title: Privacy Policy
---

I do not collect any personally identifying data. However like many other website owners, I use [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) to measure my visitors and [Disqus](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy) for commenting.

## Measuring visitors with Google Analytics

I measure visitors to my website using Google Analytics. This is a piece of software that grabs data about my visitors (you) to help website owners (me) better understand what my audience is. Google Analytics records for example:

- How you arrived on my site (e.g. direct, referral from other website, search engine)
- What pages you are viewing
- How long you stay for
- Basic information about your computerWhat including what kind of browser you are using
- Where you come from (based on your reduced IP address)

All of that information is anonymous. I don’t know who you are. Just that somebody visited my site.

The tracking information from Google Analytics allows me to better understand the kind of people who come to my site and what content they’re reading. Like most websites, I use this information to make my website better.

You do not want to be tracked? You can [opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) of Google Analytics tracking software.

## Commenting with Disqus

To allow visitors of my blog to discuss articles I use a service called Disqus. Therefore I use code which Disqus provides and I do not control by myself. Disqus does track its visitors and they remember who you are if you login to their service. This way you can comment on any website using their service.

To comment on an article, you need to login or sign up with Disqus. You can log in to Disqus in many different ways, including via Twitter or Facebook. If you access Disqus by logging in via social network, Disqus will be able to link your activity to that network and that third party may pass personally identifiable information to Disqus. In this way, your Disqus activity may be personally identifiable. Same applies of course if you sign up with Disqus and provide personally identifiable information like your name and and email address.

Disqus will also know what pages you viewed on this site and what you wrote on those comments. Of course all comments you leave are publicly visible on the Internet together with your name.

## Updates to this policy

I may update this privacy policy from time-to-time, particularly as technology and services change. You can always check this page for the latest version.

## Any questions?

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your personal data, please reach out to me by email to sjohner at outlook.com
