I am happy to speak at this years [Global Azure Bootcamp Event](http://bootcamp.azurezurichusergroup.com/) in Zürich, Switzerland! Azure Bootcamp Switzerland takes place on April 22nd at Microsoft Switzerland in Wallisellen. All around the world user groups and communities will come together once again in the fifth great Global Azure Bootcamp event! Each user group will organize their own one day deep dive class on Azure. The result is that thousands of people get to learn about Azure and join together online under the social hashtag [#GlobalAzure](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GlobalAzure)!
