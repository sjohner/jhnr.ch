I am happy to be speaking at [Experts Live Switzerland 2017](http://www.expertslive.ch/) which takes place place May 17th in Bern, Switzerland. Experts Live Switzerland 2017 is a community event which focuses on Microsoft Cloud-, Datacenter- and Workplace-Management topics. I will speak about how OMS enables modern IT management including real-time insights, control & compliance and security in the world of the hybrid cloud.
