As I was doing some Service Manager 2012 R2 Upgrades lately, I created a OneNote page which will guide me through the installation process and help me not to forget anything important :-) Since this checklist may be useful to other people out there who are upgrading from Service Manager 2012 SP1 to Service Manager 2012 R2, I decided to share myÂ [Upgrade to Service Manager 2012 R2 Checklist](/images/Upgrade-to-Service-Manager-2012-R2-Checklist.one).

I provide this checklist as-is and cannot guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of information available from the checklist. In addition to this checklist, also check out [detailed instructions by Microsoft](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn520902.aspx) on how to upgrade your environment to System Center Service Manager 2012 R2.

If you have any corrections or thoughts about improving the list please let me know. I would be happy to update the OneNote file so others can benefit from your knowledge.
