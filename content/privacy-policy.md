I do not collect any personally identifying data. However like many other website owners, I use [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) to measure my visitors and [Disqus](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy) for commenting.

## Measuring visitors with Google Analytics

I measure visitors to my website using Google Analytics. This is a piece of software that grabs data about my visitors (you) to help website owners (me) better understand what my audience is. Google Analytics records for example:

- How you arrived on my site (e.g. direct, referral from other website, search engine)
- What pages you are viewing
- How long you stay for
- Basic information about your computerWhat including what kind of browser you are using
- Where you come from (based on your reduced IP address)

All of that information is anonymous. I don’t know who you are. Just that somebody visited my site.

The tracking information from Google Analytics allows me to better understand the kind of people who come to my site and what content they’re reading. Like most websites, I use this information to make my website better.

Find more information about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use their services [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). You do not want to be tracked? You can [opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) of Google Analytics tracking software.

## Commenting with Disqus

To allow visitors of my blog to discuss articles I use a service called Disqus. Therefore I use code which Disqus provides and I do not control by myself. To comment on an article, you do not necessarly need to login or sign up with Disqus since this site is configured to allow [guest comments](https://help.disqus.com/commenting/guest-commenting).

If you decide to log in to Disqus, you can do this in many different ways, including via Twitter or Facebook. If you access Disqus by logging in via social network, Disqus will be able to link your activity to that network and that third party may pass personally identifiable information to Disqus. In this way, your Disqus activity may be personally identifiable. Same applies if you sign up with Disqus and provide personally identifiable information like your name and and email address.

Disqus will also know what pages you viewed on this site and what you wrote on those comments. Of course all comments you leave are publicly visible on the Internet together with your name.

Disqus does collect non-personally identifiable information to deliver targeted content and advertising on websites that use Disqus, as well as other websites you may visit. If you prefer to opt out of this information being collected, you may do so [on this page](https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/)

## Updates to this policy

I may update this privacy policy from time-to-time, particularly as technology and services change. You can always check this page for the latest version.

## Any questions?

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your personal data, please reach out to me by email to sjohner at outlook.com
