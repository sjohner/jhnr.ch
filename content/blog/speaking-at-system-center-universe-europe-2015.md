For all of you which do not know System Center Universe, [Marcel Zehner](http://twitter.com/marcelzehner) wrote a [nice blog post ](http://marcelzehner.ch/2015/07/26/system-center-universe-2015-europe-is-just-around-the-corner-will-you-be-there/)on why you definitely should not miss this amazing event if you are interested in any Microsoft System Center and Microsoft Cloud OS related topics. SCU Europe will bring together the Windows Server and System Center Community from all over the world, including a large quantity of Microsoft MVPs and (former) Microsoft employees.

Myself I will host the session _**Business Process Automation – A Real Real World Scenario, No Fakes Just Facts** _together with [Stefan Roth](http://twitter.com/stefanroth_net) on Tuesday. In this session we would like to provide you a real world case where we used System Center Service Manager and Service Management Automation to automate different business processes. This is NOT one of these simple “One offering, one runbook example session”. This session offers just meat and no bones. We will show you how we have architectured this solution, problems we have faced and what conclusion we came up. Hope to see you there! :-**) **

Also besides attending our session and networking parties at SCU Europe, you should make sure you have some spare time to discover the city :-) The congress center Basel enjoys a downtown location, travel times are short, and the historic old town, the shopping areas and the many museums and parks can be reached comfortably on foot or in a few minutes by public transportation.

Basel is among the most important cultural centres of Switzerland. The city comprises a large number of theatres and many museums. Also Basel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, which makes it very easy to travel within the city.

Below you can find some sight-seeing spots which are definitively worth a visit! I am looking forward to a great conference and hope to see you there!



	
  * Cathedral (Münster)
Together with the Mittlere Brücke the Cathedral is the most famous landmark of Basel. Climb the stairs up a Cathedral tower for a spectacular view.

	
  * Mittlere Brücke
Opened in 1226, it is one of the oldest Rhine crossings between Lake Constance and the North Sea.

	
  * Marktplatz (Market Place) / City Hall
Marktplatz is the centre in the Old Town which is dominated by the imposing City Hall, the seat of the government of the Canton of Basel-City.

	
  * Pfalz
The Pfalz viewing terrace in Basel offers fantastic views over the Old Town and as far as the border triangle.

Hike the Rhine Trail and follow the river from Basel to Kaiseraugst along a former embankment fishing track.
