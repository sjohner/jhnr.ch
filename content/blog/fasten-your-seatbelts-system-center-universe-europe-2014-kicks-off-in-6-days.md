For all of you which do not know System Center Universe, [Thomas Maurer](http://twitter.com/thomasmaurer) wrote a [nice blog post ](http://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2014/08/system-center-universe-europe-the-microsoft-cloudos-event-you-shouldnt-miss/)on why you definitely should not miss this amazing event if you are interested in any Microsoft System Center and Microsoft Cloud OS related topics. SCU Europe will bring together the Windows Server and System Center Community from all over the world, including a large quantity of Microsoft MVPs and (former) Microsoft employees.<!-- more -->

Since there will be a lot of Service Manager experts present at System Center Universe, this is an excellent occasion to learn from the best and most experienced experts and community leaders.  For those of you which are especially interested in Service Manager content, I tried to create a small overview of Service Manager sessions presented at System Center Universe 2014. I myself will have the chance to host a session with my colleague and CDM MVP [Marcel Zehner](http://twitter.com/marcelzehner) on Friday September 19 about Service Manager customizations.

That's it for the Service Manager sessions. There are plenty of other System Center and Microsoft Cloud OS related sessions which are definitively worth attending! I recommend using the SCU Europe Session Planning Tool to make the most out of your visit of SCU Europe 2014. And don't forget to attend the networking and closing parties on Thursday and Friday! :-)

Also besides attending sessions and networking parties at SCU Europe, you should make sure you have some spare time to discover the city. The congress center Basel enjoys a downtown location, travel times are short, and the historic old town, the shopping areas and the many museums and parks can be reached comfortably on foot or in a few minutes by public transportation.

Basel is among the most important cultural centres of Switzerland. The city comprises a large number of theatres and many museums. Also Basel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, which makes it very easy to travel within the city.

Below you can find some sight-seeing spots which are definitively worth a visit! I am looking forward to a great conference and hope to see you there!



 	
  * Cathedral (Münster)
Together with the Mittlere Brücke the Cathedral is the most famous landmark of Basel. Climb the stairs up a Cathedral tower for a spectacular view.

 	
  * Mittlere Brücke
Opened in 1226, it is one of the oldest Rhine crossings between Lake Constance and the North Sea.

 	
  * Marktplatz (Market Place) / City Hall
Marktplatz is the centre in the Old Town which is dominated by the imposing City Hall, the seat of the government of the Canton of Basel-City.

 	
  * Pfalz
The Pfalz viewing terrace in Basel offers fantastic views over the Old Town and as far as the border triangle.

 	
  * Rhine Trail: Basel - Kaiseraugst














Hike the Rhine Trail and follow the river from Basel to Kaiseraugst along a former embankment fishing track.
