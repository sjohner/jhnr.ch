[Microsoft Ignite](http://ignite.microsoft.com/#fbid=lIvACQzPSKG), which is set to take place May 4-8 in Chicago, promises to provide plenty  of information, announcements, demos and events of course :-)
Unfortunately I will not be able to attend and I am sure I am going to miss a lot of great people and events course. However thanks to [Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com) I definitively wont miss any sessions :-)

Below you can find all the Service Manager related sessions announced so far. I was a bit disappointed to see that only two sessions are published yet. Hopefully there are going to be some more until the conference starts. Both sessions are announced as Level 200 Overview and Business Value sessions, so don't expect much technical detail.
