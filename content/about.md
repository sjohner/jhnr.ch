title: Me in a nutshell
layout: page

Donâ€™t worry, I promise I wonâ€™t write about myself in the third person. ðŸ˜‰

Iâ€™m a Switzerland-based IT guy that kind of specialises in cloud computing. Since 2007, Iâ€™ve worked in different roles at a range of tech companies and corporations. I started as a Linux Engineer and then worked as a consultant in the good old Microsoft System Center and the at that time emerging  Azure Cloud space. After that I had the privilege to accompany the development and operation of public cloud platforms in large enterprises as a product owner and product manager. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex customer problems from planning all the way through to implementation.

I am passionate about technology and it amazes me how it massively influences the world to run faster and more efficiently. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and enthusasm for technology by [tweeting](https://bsky.app/profile/jhnr.ch), blogging and speaking at events. I believe in the power of the collective and that's why i like to get involved in the community. Be it as co-organizer of the [Azure Bootcamp Switzerland](https://azurebootcamp.ch), the [Azure Bern User Group](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/azure-cloud-bern-user-group/) or in the board of the local sports club. Since 2016, I have regularly received the MVP Award from Microsoft for this commitment to the community.
