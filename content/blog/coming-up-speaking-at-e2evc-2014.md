I am sure some of you know that the next [Experts to Experts Virtualization Conference (E2EVC)](http://www.e2evc.com/home/Home.aspx) will take place in Brussels from May 30th to June 1st. E2EVC is a non-commercial community event since it first took place in 2003. E2EVC is a community event and sessions are hosted both by independent community experts as well as vendor product teams. Products from all the big vendors in the virtualization area are covered.

I will have the chance to present two sessions beyond the scope of virtualization with my colleague [Marcel Zehner](http://marcelzehner.ch). We will be hosting two sessions on Saturday May 31st about how to build your own System Center lab and about extending System Center with your own identity management solution.

Apart from Marcel, I will be traveling with my colleagues [Thomas Maurer](http://www.thomasmaurer.ch/) and [Michael Rüfli](http://www.miru.ch). So there will be quite some [itnetx ](http://www.itnetx.ch)power at E2EVC 2014 :-) Looking forward to a great conference and hope to see you there!
