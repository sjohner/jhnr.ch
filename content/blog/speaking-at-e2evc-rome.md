Together with my buddy [Stefan Roth](http://twitter.com/stefanroth_net), I will speak at the _[Experts 2 Experts Virtualization Conference](http://www.e2evc.com/home)_ 2016 which will take place from November 18th-20th in Rome. E2EVC is a non-commercial, virtualization and Citrix community Event. The main goal of the event is to bring the best virtualization and Citrix experts together to exchange knowledge and to establish new connections. After speaking at E2EVC Brussels in 2014 and E2EVC Lisbon in 2015 I am very happy to be back at E2EVC Rome 2016!

In our session, we will show you what happens if Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS) meets with Citrix and VMware. Microsoft OMS is a suite of solutions for different Microsoft technologies, but it also provides a platform for injecting data via different interfaces. The injected data can be visualized and used for deep data analysis. We will give you and overview what OMS can do in terms of Citrix and VMware and how a Citrix or VMware administrator can benefit from using Microsoft Operations Management Suite.

We would be happy to see you in our session which (most certainly ;-)) will take place on **Saturday 19th from 5:45pm till 6:20pm**.
