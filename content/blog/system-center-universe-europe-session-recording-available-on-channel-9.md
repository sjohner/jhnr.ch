Together with [Marcel Zehner ](http://twitter.com/marcelzehner)I hosted a session at [System Center Universe Europe 2014](http://www.systemcenteruniverse.ch/) which took place in September. Me and Marcel were presenting a collection of useful real-world customizations that we have built for customers during the last years. If you would like to see the session, Microsoft made the [session recordings available for you on Channel9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/SCUE2014/Customer-requirements-first-Service-Manager-customizations-without-limits).
