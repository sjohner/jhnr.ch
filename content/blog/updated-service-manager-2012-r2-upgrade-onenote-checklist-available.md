As I was doing another Service Manager 2012 R2 Upgrade lately, I added some minor improvements to my [Upgrade to Service Manager 2012 R2 Checklist](/images/Upgrade-to-Service-Manager-2012-R2-Checklist.one).

If you have any corrections or thoughts about improving the checklist, please let me know. I would be happy to update the OneNote file so others can benefit from your knowledge.

I provide this checklist as-is and cannot guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of information available from the checklist. In addition to this checklist, also check out [detailed instructions by Microsoft](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn520902.aspx) on how to upgrade your environment to System Center Service Manager 2012 R2.
