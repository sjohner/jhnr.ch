Together with my mate [Stefan Roth ](http://twitter.com/stefanroth_net)I will speak at the _[Experts 2 Experts Virtualization Conference](http://www.e2evc.com/home)_ which takes place from November 13th-15th in Lisbon. E2EVC is a non-commercial, virtualisation community Event. The main goal of the event is to bring the best virtualisation experts together to exchange knowledge and to establish new connections. After speaking at E2EVC Brussels in 2014 I am very happy to be back at E2EVC Lisbon 2015!

Me and Stefan will not go deep into any virtualisation topics but instead we will cover a real world scenario which combines the raw power of System Center Service Manager (SCSM) and Service Management Automation (SMA) when it comes to automation and self-service. We will present some insides on how we started the project, problems we faced during development and implementation as well as some lessons learned.

We would be happy to see you in our session which (most certainly ;-) will take place on **Friday 13th from 5pm till 6pm**. See you there :-)
