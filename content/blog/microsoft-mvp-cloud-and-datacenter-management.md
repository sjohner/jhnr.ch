I would like to thank my family, friends, and mentors. Without their help and support, this probably never would have happened. Special thanks go to [Marcel Zehner](https://twitter.com/MarcelZehner) and the whole team of my employer [itnetX](http://itnetx.ch). Thank you for giving me the opportunity to learn and grow :-) Of course I also want to thank [Stefan Roth](https://twitter.com/stefanroth_net), [Janaka Rangama](https://twitter.com/JanakaRangama) and [Stefan Koell](https://twitter.com/StefanKoell) who actively supported my nomination in the best possible way!

# About the Microsoft MVP Award

The Microsoft MVP Award is an annual award that recognizes exceptional technology community leaders worldwide who actively share their real world expertise with users and Microsoft.

The following excerpt is taken directly from the Microsoft MVP website:
>Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals, or MVPs, are technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with the community. They are always on the "bleeding edge" and have an unstoppable urge to get their hands on new, exciting technologies. They have very deep knowledge of Microsoft products and services, while also being able to bring together diverse platforms, products and solutions, to solve real world problems. MVPs are driven by their passion, community spirit and their quest for knowledge. Above all and in addition to their amazing technical abilities, MVPs are _always_ willing to help others - that's what sets them apart.
